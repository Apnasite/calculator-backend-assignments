**Title:** Scientific Calculator  

**Tool Details:**  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js  
- **Frontend:** Web Components (Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS)  
- **Database (if needed):** None (stateless calculation)  

**Goal:**  
By completing this assignment, candidates will gain hands-on experience in developing a full-stack application, integrating an Express.js backend with a WebComponent-based frontend. They will also learn how to dynamically generate AI-driven calculations and process mathematical formulas through API calls.

**Assignment Description:**  
Candidates will develop a scientific calculator application where the frontend consists of a WebComponent-based form. Users will input mathematical expressions, and the backend will process these calculations using JavaScriptâ€™s built-in math functions. The backend should return the computed results dynamically. AI will generate example calculations and test cases to validate the system.

**Tasks & Steps:**  
1. **Backend API Development (Express.js)**  
   - Set up an Express.js server.  
   - Create an API endpoint (`/calculate`) to process user input.  
   - Implement logic to parse mathematical expressions securely.  
   - Return the result as a JSON response.  

2. **Frontend Integration (Web Components)**  
   - Create a WebComponent-based UI with an input form for users to enter expressions.  
   - Add a button to send the input to the backend.  
   - Display the calculated result dynamically.  
   - Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes.  

3. **Result Display & Error Handling**  
   - Display calculated results in real-time.  
   - Handle invalid input cases with proper error messages.  
   - Implement loading indicators for better user experience.  

**Mathematical Calculation/Steps:**  
- Candidates must support basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /) and advanced functions (sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, power, factorial).  
- The backend should securely evaluate user inputs, avoiding security risks like `eval()`.  
- Example Expressions: `5+3`, `sqrt(16)`, `log(100)`, `sin(45)`, `3^4`.

**Third-Party Packages (if required):**  
- `express` (for backend API)  
- `mathjs` (for mathematical computation)  
- `cors` (for enabling frontend-backend communication)  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Backend API correctly processes and returns calculated results.  
- WebComponent-based frontend successfully integrates with the backend.  
- The UI is user-friendly, responsive, and displays results correctly.  
- Proper error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases.  
- AI-generated test cases validate correctness.

**Submission Guidelines:**  
1. Fork the provided repository.
