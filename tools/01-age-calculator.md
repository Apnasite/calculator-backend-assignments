Title: Age Calculator
Tool Details:
•	Backend: Express.js
•	Frontend: WebComponent-based UI
Goal:
Candidates will learn how to create a backend API using Express.js and integrate it with a WebComponent-based frontend. They will gain hands-on experience in handling user input, processing data on the backend, and dynamically updating the frontend with AI-generated results.
Assignment Description:
Develop an age calculator where users input their date of birth (DOB) in the frontend form. The backend receives the input, calculates the user's age dynamically using AI-generated logic, and sends the result back to the frontend for display.
Tasks & Steps:
Backend API Development (Express.js)
1.	Set up an Express.js server.
2.	Create an endpoint that accepts a date of birth as input.
3.	Implement logic to calculate the age dynamically.
4.	Return the calculated age in a JSON response.
Frontend Development (WebComponent)
1.	Create a WebComponent with a form to input DOB.
2.	Send the input data to the backend via an API request.
3.	Display the returned age dynamically in the UI.
Integration & Result Display:
1.	Ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend.
2.	Display age updates without requiring a full page refresh.
Mathematical Calculation/Steps:
•	Extract the year, month, and day from the input DOB.
•	Get the current date.
•	Calculate the difference to determine the exact age.
•	AI should generate custom messages based on age ranges (e.g., "You are in your 20s, a great time to explore new skills!").
Third-Party Packages (if required):
•	express (for backend API)
•	cors (for handling cross-origin requests)
•	body-parser (for parsing request body, if needed)
Acceptance Criteria:
•	The backend correctly processes and returns the age based on the given DOB.
•	The frontend successfully sends requests and displays the age dynamically.
•	The application provides AI-generated insights/messages along with the age.
•	The solution follows best coding practices and is well-structured.
Submission Guidelines:
1.	Fork the repository provided in the assignment.
2.	Create a folder with your GitHub username.
3.	Implement the backend and frontend inside your folder.
4.	Push the code to your forked repository.
5.	Submit a pull request for review.
