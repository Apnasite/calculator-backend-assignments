**Title: Salary Calculator**

**Tool Details:**
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Frontend:** WebComponent-based UI
- **Database (Optional):** JSON storage or in-memory data handling

**Goal:**
Candidates will learn to:
- Develop a RESTful API using Express.js
- Implement a WebComponent-based frontend for user input and result display
- Integrate frontend and backend through API calls
- Process and return salary calculations dynamically

**Assignment Description:**
The objective of this assignment is to build a full-stack Salary Calculator. The frontend will feature a form where users input basic salary, tax percentage, and other deductions. The backend will process the data, compute the net salary, and return the result for display on the frontend. AI should generate different input values dynamically for testing purposes.

**Tasks & Steps:**
1. **Backend API Development:**
   - Set up an Express.js server.
   - Create an endpoint to receive basic salary, tax percentage, and deductions.
   - Perform salary calculations based on the input.
   - Return computed results to the frontend.

2. **Frontend Development:**
   - Create a WebComponent-based form with input fields for salary, tax, and deductions.
   - Send form data to the backend using fetch API.
   - Display the computed net salary received from the backend.

3. **Integration & Testing:**
   - Ensure the frontend correctly sends user input to the backend.
   - Validate responses from the backend.
   - Handle errors gracefully in both frontend and backend.

**Mathematical Calculation/Steps:**
- **Net Salary Calculation:**
  - `Net Salary = Basic Salary - (Tax + Deductions)`
  - Tax is calculated as `Basic Salary Ã— (Tax Percentage / 100)`
  - Ensure correct handling of different deduction types.

**Third-Party Packages (if required):**
- `express` (for backend API)
- `cors` (to handle cross-origin requests)
- `body-parser` (for processing JSON input)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The backend API correctly receives and processes input data.
- The WebComponent-based frontend interacts seamlessly with the backend.
- The salary calculation is accurate, considering tax and deductions.
- AI dynamically generates input scenarios for testing.
- The frontend displays results in a user-friendly manner.
